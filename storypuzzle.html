    title: "Chapter 1 - Joey Banks",
    raw: "I cant believe that out of how many kids none of us have made it big time Possibly by the way most of the kids in my form used to shoplift some might be serving big time In the summer for sport we had the choice between cricket,softball and swimming Apart from the cricket and softball teams,the rest of us ran a muck at Bankstown Olympic swimming pool. They used to double the number of inspectors and still they couldn't keep us under control.If you weren't reprimanded at least ten times for doing bombs or belly flopping onto someone's head, then you were a wimp Our teacher, Mr Yabserly or Uncle Stew as we used to call him, heid the record for the highest number of casualties. I think the only reason he kept his job was because he held something over our, slap happy, Cane bearing, assembly compulsive, control freak of a deputy head master, Gaskil. The Gaskil'.If you wanted to get into a fight or really hurt someone's feelings, you called them a 'Gaskil.' Woo! After they dropped us back at school, two busloads of terrors would ascend upon the milk bar across the road. It was a tiny little shop run by a half blind, half deaf old man. They used to call him Old Man Charity, because he gave to the needy - them! Every time he turned his back they would help themselves to handfuls of packets of Black Cats, Life Savers, Fruit Tingles (always a favourite), packets of chips and all sorts of drinks. You name it, someone had stolen it. Old Man Charity had no idea. It used to annoy me that I could barely afford a musk stick, then come outside and see kids tucking into four litre tubs of ice cream and black forest cakes, which they had just pilfered. Eventually I succumbed to temptation and decided I would join the criminals. After all, why should I spend my hard earned pocket money when everyone else was getting away with it? Actually, my pocket money wasn't hard earned at all. All I had to do was wash up now and then and stay out of trouble. Dad used to hand it over and say 'Here's your pocket money son. Don't spend it all in one place, keep out of trouble and help your mother now and then. He had an expression for every situation. Once, I  jumped over a hedge in a park. I thought I was cool flying over it but on the other side was a two metre drop. He leaned over the top and saw me in a heap. Then asked, 'Are you all right son? Yeah' I said licking my wounds 'Well next time, look before you leap! You're lucky it wasn't a twenty foot drop. If he knew I was planning to shoplift not only would it have broken an honest man's heart and I could imagine all the clichés he would punish me with, crime doesn't pay! Honesty is the best policy and it wouldn't matter if you prepared yourself for all of the obvious ones, he would have another twenty up his sleeve. 'What's the world coming to? No son of mine!' He was genius at running them together, 'It's a sad day when a son of mine, to whom your mother and I have always taught, honesty is the best policy, I'm disappointed in you,disappointed vou've taken this criminal path .Where did your mother and I go wrong? What is the world coming to? I give up!' There would be no mercy to his disappointment. The next week at the pool I took two hours to decide that I would steal a handful of cigar chewing gums. A luxury served for the wealthy or 'The Thieves.' Honest paupers like me could only afford the essentials; things like water from the bubblers and thank god for Paddle Pops. Which hand I would use and which pocket. The bus ride home was a sweaty one. It looked as though I hadn't dried myself properly but I was determined to go through with it. I'd only ever stolen one thing in my life and my conscience was now reminding me of it. In Second class I had an unbearable walk home. It was up a long gradual  hill. A friend of my mother's had stupidly told us that The Boogie Man would  get us if  we weren't home before 4 o'clock, and I believed her. She hadn't specifically described an, so in my imagination it was the most hide imaginable. Even worse than, The Gaskil', whom I will describe in more detail later. The most terrible fate any human being could fall into.. By the time I'd reached the top of the book I was buggered from hurrying. I would rest at the shops sometimes even browse around the hardware shop. After all, I had at least five minutes up my sleeve after I got home before Boogie Man would spit acid in my face and on my feet, until I couldn't walk or see any more, and drag me off into the never return, I had become obsessed with a little tin of hobby paint. I thought it was the most incredible thing in the whole world. I really wanted it, but I couldn't afford it because it was a dollar fifty. One day I was in the shop and the man behind the counter was nowhere to be seen and before I knew it, I had the tin in my possession and was halfway down Gibson Avenue, round the Waterboard and in Gow St. Now I would have to face NELSON AVE. It was a bastard of a hill that used to kill Mormons. It would try and zap your last ounce of strength to slow you down so The Boogie Man could get you. Today, they were no match! I trod on the toes of adversity and poked The Boogie Man in the eye. I decided to forgo the obligatory bowl of Coco Pops and Cartoon Corner, my usual reward for making it home safely and went straight to my room so I could admire my spoils. Suddenly I was overcome with guilt. I thought about the the consequences of my actions. I had stolen something that cost an incredible dollar fifty, surely this would put the hardware shop out of business and they would send the police looking for me. I then knew I would have to go to jail. I realised I had absolutely no use for this stupid little tin of paint. I didn't even like the colour. I had to get rid of it. But where? How? I looked around and found the most incredible hiding place for it. It was the best place in the whole world. Under the bottom draw in my wardrobe. No one would be able to find it there, not even the police. Even though I had the best-est you beaut, hiding place in the whole world, I had to get it out of the house. Then it came to me, take it back! Brilliant! If I could get back in the shop without discovery, then my problems would be over. I had to be careful because I have seen too many cop shows not to know that a criminal always returns to the scene of the crime. I would have to bide my time as the shop would already be swarming with police and surrounded by undercover cops, parked out the front in unmarked cars, sipping coffee. Every day when I walked past the shop I tried not to attract attention to myself, but observed everything. A month later, when I was sure it was safe, I orchestrated my plan. I had my hand in my pocket and the tin of paint in my hand. I didn't take it out of my pocket all day. My hand was sweating so much it looked like I'd pissed myself again! As I approached the hardware shop I gave the routine check, convinced it was safe, I went inside. The shop assistant was busy serving another customer. The other tins were gone! Calmly I located where they had moved to and checked out the shop assistant's where abouts. I only had to take it out of my pocket and I was safe. He was looking down, you beauty! It was out! I casually studied it for a while then, replaced it and left. My conscience felt exonerated, Would I be so lucky this time? I wondered as the bus pulled in front of the school. As usual, we all made a beeline to the shop. For the first time Old Man Charity had a helper. Judging by his features, it could have been Old Man Charity Jr. My instincts were telling me not to go through with it, but I put that down to fear. Besides, while I was waiting I could see all the other kids getting away with it. I never noticed how much everyone pushed and shoved before. I was out of reach of my beloved cigars so I pushed my way into a more strategic position. I studied Old Man Charity Senior and Jr. carefully. Senior was nothing but Junior was sharp. I had to be careful. Now I was up front and it was my turn. Old Man Charity had just turned his back. I focused on my cigars. Go! I thought. As I fumbled in the cigars, out of the corner of my eye I saw someone else strike. I couldn't help but admire their speed. They snatched, grabbed and escaped with the goods before I'd even taken my cigar chewing gum out of the box. I managed about five into my pocket when Old Man Charity senior grabbed my arm. He yelled in a chilling voice, 'PUT THOSE BACK!' When I'd looked up at him, his eyes relayed absolute anger and disappointment. 'AND GET OUT OF MY SHOP!' You could see that this poor proud old man felt betrayed. I was so humiliated I cried all the way home. I've never shoplifted since. Every now and then I have this recurring dream. (I don't know if that incident has anything to do with it), I'm eating chewing gum and I decided to get rid of it. The more I try to take it out of my mouth, the more it grows. I'm like a lifesaver feeding line to his colleague except the line is in my mouth and I'm the drowning man. Also, I wake up feeling betrayed. I know I was only a kid and I know it was only a few cigar chewing gums but I swear I will always remember the look that Old Man Charity gave me forever",

    title: "Chapter 5- The Scabs",
    raw: "I had two ways of hiding my wet patches Id tie my sloppy joe around my waist so that the sleeves would hang down in front of my pants And I used to hide it by walking around constantly with my shirt hanging out. Actually when it came to cool, that was my only saving grace. What with my light gray shiny, wet fronted flairs and my brown shiny briefcase. I could have been made an outcast, like The Scabs. We used to be able to get a five cent refund on our soft drink bottles. Quite a sum! Three bottles and you get a Chock Wedge but totally UN-hip. There was no way you would return them, no matter how desperate you were. You would roll them across the canteen and call 'Scab'! Invariably Jason Archer or one of the other scabs would collect it. To the chorus of 'SCAB! SCAB! SCAAAB'! When it came to scabs there was an unwritten law. Thou shall not befriend a scab or the wrath of a thousand Gaskils shall fall upon ye! Even the scabs used to call each other scabs but Jason Archer didn't care because he was the Scab's scab. He was making a fortune. On one trip he would have a bottle on every finger and a few tucked under each arm. That was almost a dollar a trip and he used to make about twenty trips just in recess and god knows how many during lunch. By the end of Year Seven, Jason Archer was probably a millionaire. Although by Year Eight the bottom had fallen out of the scabbing business. There were three scabs for every bottle. However, Jason Archer was still getting the majority of the bottles. He used to run the other scabs over with his shopping trolley. Maybe that's what happened to Jason Archer, he became the president of Camaico or maybe he just collects the trolleys for Woolworth's, who knows? Actually I don't think Jason Archer would have had any friends even if he wasn't a scab. He used to look like he was dressed by his mother, A dead giveaway was the jumper tucked into his undies, a shocking look, especially in summer. To make it worse, he used to wear - only for grandfathers and children, Guess whose mum's got a Whirlpool, Y-front jockettes that used to ride halfway up his back. He was the only one in our year still warring Six Class shorts, coupled with long socks and sandals. And, not only did he wear a yellow raincoat, he had the matching yellow fire cap. Fair enough, I had a yellow raincoat but I used to only wear it out the door to make my mother happy. Three streets around the corner from school. I used to take it off and hide it. It was cool to lob at school wringing wet cause you used to get to spend first period in front of the radiator, making strands of cotton float up on the heat. But even on a cloudy day, Jason Archer would wear his yellow raincoat. Or sometimes he would just wear his yellow fire cap all by itself. He also had a personality people would love to hate. People were constantly punching him in the head. I used to think it was cruel. Until one day, in the middle of summer, on a stinking hot day. I was passing him and asked him if he was hot in his jumper. I don't know if it was my tone or maybe I wasn't the first to ask him the same question, but he returned my concern by hitting me in the balls with his briefcase. I remember seeing it flash before my eyes and thinking. 'Christ, I've got the same bag as Jason Archer!' Then, overcoming the pain, I punched him fair on the nose. I remember hearing a cheer, looking up and seeing a few people at the window clapping; one was Uncle Stew. Jeez, belting Jason Archer was a good feeling!"

  title: "Chapter 6 - The first person I ever wanted to kill",
  raw: `I only ever clonked one other person on the nose before that Stephen Wilkinson  He was twice my size but I still felt bad because his father died at an early age and we all felt sorry for him. He used to dribble the ball in soccer the wrong way but he still got picked and was a dork, but we let him hang around. This day he was hassling me. I warned him, but he persisted. Dead father or no dead father, I didn't care. I warned him but he persisted, so I whacked him. He said, "I'll get you for that Noble!" I replied, "Wake up to yourself, Wilkinson!"

Then two years later, I was walking to class. Strangely enough, I was at the same area where I reigned victoriously over Jason Archer when I heard, "Come on Noble!" I turned around and the sun was fair in my eyes but I could make out Wilkinson's silhouette. Suddenly I felt these massive blows about my head. It was all over in less than a minute, but he had broken my nose and chipped my front two teeth. I hadn't even thrown a punch. My dad made me go to school the next day because he said that I had to show him and not let him get the better of me. So I went  black eyes, chipped teeth, broken nose and all. Boy, that must have shown him!

I wonder what happened to Steven Wilkinson? Changed his name to Jeff Feneech and won a world title, I should imagine. You know every time I look in the mirror and notice my chipped tooth, I wonder if I was a black belt and bumped into him, what would I do? Let bygones be bygones and show him some Christian forgiveness? Or smash him within an inch of his life. It's silly wondering really because I'm not a black belt. Seven Nelson Ave. had an outside toilet and no light and once, after watching a Bruce Lee movie, I was Kung fu‑ing my way back to the safety of inside, where my father, who had gotten up for a glass of water said shaking his head, "You watch too many bloody movies you do!" Embarrassed I put aside my aspirations of becoming Bruce Lee and went to bed.

Until years later when the TV series Kung Fu came on. After every episode, I would practise the skills Ki chain had mastered; walking on the rice paper, or in my case, lightly down the hall after my parents had gone to sleep trying not to wake them. Speaking in a whisper and listening for the grasshopper; I stopped doing that one after I heard my parents making love.

Then came one of my embarrassing memories. Secretly I did want to learn Kung Fu but it was so expensive and I could imagine my father going off if I asked him if I could learn; so instead I kept watching Kung Fu and practising. Until one day, I can't remember how, I found out but apparently Warrick Kidd learnt Kung Fu. I asked and he agreed to teach me. Lessons were brief and were not structured. I would just find him in the playground and he would quickly show me how to block or a couple of other fatal moves. Then one day, it was all on — Jason Archer and Warrick Kidd, my mentor in a fight with the King of the Scabs. I felt sorry for him knowing that he was about to be maimed or killed and wondered if he had a will and who he would leave his millions to. The fight lasted less than three minutes; Archer destroyed Kidd and at the same time shattered my illusion. Kidd was the only person Jason Archer ever beat. My mentor!

The only other person I nearly bopped on the nose was Michael Hastie. The only reason I didn't was because he got lucky. Unfortunately, a metal pole got in the way of his head. Of course that made him laugh, which only added to my anger. He was the first person I have ever wanted to kill. I thought I would have been doing the world a favour if I did. Michael Hastie had a flatulence problem`,

  title: "Chapter 7 - Primary School",
  raw: `Primary school was a real awakening for me because all the kids were suddenly becoming individuals Gary Hall and his friend Warren O'Brien were our first nonconformists. They were the first rebels my age with homemade tattoos. Warren Brian had a big bug on his leg with 'you mole' written inside it. Gary Hall had a cross on his wrist.

Until then Warren was just the weird one with the long hair and Gary was the one with rotten teeth. Later, Gary came into his own when he was the first one to get a real tattoo. It was the funniest, bravest, most stupid tattoo in the whole world, in the most bizarre place: inside his bottom lip. He simply had the words 'get fucked elegantly' tattooed in there. When anyone asked him to show his tattoo he would pull down his bottom lip exposing it. If you upset him or a teacher was giving him a hard time, down would go his bottom lip. Many a time he was sent out of class for that very reason. I reckon everyone at Padstow North Primary asked him at least twenty times if they could see it and he always obliged them, and this continued into high school. I often imagine him as a grumpy, tired old man with no teeth and his bottom lip drooped down to his knees. And whenever anyone came near him he would just point to his tattoo.

He also had an amazing ability with flies. He would always have one in captivity and, like his tattoo, was only too pleased to show you. You'd say, 'Gary, show us your fly,' and he would take out a matchbox, carefully open it, and the next minute there would be a fly buzzing around in circles. It was chained to his finger by a long strand of hair. After a few laps he would reel it in like a fisherman lands a catch, roll it up in the hair, and carefully place it back in the matchbox ready for the next show. I thought it was really cool so I tried it a few times, but all I managed to do was chop off the fly's head.`

    title: "Chapter 8 - Lewie and Stew",
    raw: "I always thought having a tattoo was pretty cool even though I knew my parents would kill me. My Uncle Lew has two arms full of tattoos. He is not my real blood uncle but he is the best uncle I have ever had. Technically he is my real uncle because my grandmother adopted him by law when he was eighteen. She used to run a boarding house and Uncle Lew was one of the lodgers. For some strange reason he needed a guardian which turned out to be my grandmother.I found all this out the day we went to visit my Uncle Lews real mother. It came as a shock to discover she was alive. Unfortunately she was a victim of Parkinsons disease. For years she could not remember her own name let alone my Uncle Lews and apparently she was on her last legs. Hence the reason for the visit. I could never understand why my sister and I had to attend the visit to this poor dying woman. I had never seen anyone that close to death before. I said hello but she did not reply and why would she? I never said another word during the visit. I mainly focused on her shaking hands and inside my head kept repeating the phrase ooh waa ooh waa over and over until the six hour visit was over. Uncle Lew still lives with my grandmother and shows her undying devotion. I could never work out why. Ever since I can remember they have bickered like dogs and cats. I used to love watching them. They would sit next to each other in their seventies green vinyl lounge chairs separated by Uncle Lews free standing orange vinyl seventies ashtray with the pewter horse head. They would argue over what to watch and who was going to change the channel. Uncle Lew would chain smoke and every time my grandmother complained Oh Lewie do you have to he would reply in the same agitated voice Shut up woman It was the repetition that made me laugh.Every time she asked if he wanted a cuppa he would reply Coffee black six sugars. It used to annoy the hell out of her. I know I know Crumbs you would think I had never made him a cup of coffee she would always reply. " +

        "Most of my school holidays and free time were spent at my grandmothers. I loved it there because it was right on the beach. Every Sunday our whole family would visit. The only drag was the two hour drive each way and my Nanas kidney and liver stew. I love my Nan and I am lucky enough to be able to eat anything but her stews pushed my tastebuds to the limits of human endurance. However she made the best cookies and cheese on toast in the world. Even if she did occasionally forget to wash her hands after going to the toilet. Many a time I would be hoeing into her famous three inch thick melted cheese on toast hoping to God she had washed her hands before making it.  She would buy a house Uncle Lew would fix it up and she would sell it and buy another. This was her third house and my favourite a small cottage a stones throw from Bulli Beach. It was a madhouse when we arrived. Samson her long haired German shepherd would go into a frenzy like Dino when Fred Flintstone arrived home. He would knock furniture flying and sometimes even bowl my grandmother over. He loved me because I played with him when he was a puppy. He would charge into the house to say hello jump up and put both paws on my shoulders licking me fair in the face like it was covered in honey knocking me over in the process. He was a monster of a dog who barked at anything that moved outside the fence but he was loving affectionate and faithful to me  Once some kids were throwing rocks at me so I went back and got Sammy. To my delight we chased them up a tree and into the nearby shelter. Pebbles their other dog who had the worst bowels in the world would start barking. Samson Pebbles Get out Get out! Both my grandmother and Uncle Lew would be screaming Shut up Shut up Get out Get out Pebbles Samson Pebbles Do you have to? After we got Sammy and Pebbles outside I would head straight for the surf and would not return until lunchtime. What the worms biting are they my grandmother would chuckle You must have radar she would say as she took the raisin cookies out of the oven Wait until they are cold Gawd you would think he has never eaten! While I was surfing my parents Uncle Lew and my grandmother played cards. Occasionally they were joined by Uncle John Johnny P the Fink and Jimmy a strange quiet man who never said much and rode a Harley. They were three of her other lodgers. They took their card games very seriously. You are gone now Fink Shut up and put up Gawd woman what are you waiting for invitation? We used to play Trouble and it was for keeps. My sister did not have a killer instinct and apologised every time she landed on someone except me. I used to count the number of spaces I needed to land on someone and pray for that number before I pushed the popper. Sending home my sister Uncle Lew Nan my mother and especially my father who would get this I am going to get you back look was a sweet victory. I was such a bad winner doing a victory lap around the table singing WHO IS THE CHAMPION ME ME ME WHO IS THE CHAMPION ME ME ME!  If I showed any interest in Uncle Lews tattoos the whole family would be up in arms. My father would say how stupid they were and fifteen minutes later he would still be halfway through his lecture. You do not ever want to get one of those you will regret it Won't he Lewie You regret yours do you Lewie? Poor Uncle Lew. I always suspected he actually enjoyed his tats. I could picture him up The Cross with his rough neck mates sleeves rolled up showing off their tattoos and scaring tourists. Yeah he would sheepishly reply every time, I regret them. I still thought the idea of having a homemade tattoo was cool and wanted one. I took my compass and carved a cross in my leg near my ankle. But I was too scared to use any ink. Even though I picked the scab off once my tattoo healed and disappeared within a week. "

  "title": "Chapter Nine - Repeating Six Class",
  "raw": "Its funny how nature is attracted to the bizarre. I remember there was a buzz in the playground when Gregory Alchin took out his glass eye. We all knew he had a glass eye because his eyes were never pointing in the same direction and they never moved in sync. His real eye seemed to be cross-eyed as well, so it was really hard to know if he was talking to you or the person next to you. Until now, no one realised that he could actually take it out.\n\nA big crowd was gathering. Everyone was asking each other if they were going to look at Alchin's eye socket. People were coming back shaking their heads with horror—an opportunity too good to miss. I think I waited in line for about ten minutes and finally, when it was my turn, even though there wasn't much to see—pardon the pun—my stomach turned and I experienced my first encounter with the thrill of horror. The next time was seeing my grandmother's undies hanging on the line, but that is another story I do not want to go into.\n\nI actually repeated Six Class and the worst thing about it was, no one told me that I was going to repeat. It was devastating! I remember at the final assembly of the year and they were calling everyone's name and telling them what class they would be going into. Once you had that information you could leave. They were up to the Ps—about half the kids had left—and I hadn't heard my name, so I was getting a bit worried. By the Ws I assumed that I simply missed hearing my name. I waited patiently for all the names to be called, went over to the Deputy Headmaster Mr Frasier and explained to him how I had missed my name.\n\n\"Hasn't anyone told you?\" he asked in astonishment. \"You're staying with us another year.\" I could feel the tears welling up in my eyes. \"Mrs Shields and your parents,\" he continued—while I hid the total betrayal I felt finding out my parents were in on it as well—\"thought it would be better for you if you repeated Six Class because the other kids in high school are a little bit more mature and another year would give you a chance to catch up.\"\n\n\"A BIT MORE MATURE!\" I replied, gasping on each syllable with tears streaming down my cheeks. I don't know if I was howling because of the disbelief, the betrayal, or the complete humiliation of having to repeat Six Class. Or the fact that deep down I knew what he was saying was true.\n\nThere were only three other kids that repeated that year: Jason Archer; Wendy Slaughter—who spent half the day staring at the sky, blinking and waving her fingers in front of her eyes—who, by the way, ended up at the same special school as Michael Mitchell; and the only other one was, you guessed it, Robert Brough.\n\nI don't really remember Six Class the first time around, but as you can read, the second time has left a lasting impression. We all used to play together. The boys, that is. You see, the boys and the girls never played together. The girls could always make an idiot out of any boy daring to venture into the beautiful and strange world of Elastics and Skipping.\n\nBefore class it was skiing. The two playing fields of Padstow North—separating infants, you know behind Rhonda Mare's, where later I was to send 'The Neck' into fits of ecstasy—used to slope down on about a thirty-degree angle. On a spring morning the grass would be covered in dew and it was very slippery. Two kids would run down the gentle slope as fast as they could, dragging the skier for the ride of his life. It was great unless your shoe came off or you lost your balance. Then you would either end up soaked, or you would spend the whole day with wet smelly socks. Of course, that was the aim of the pullers, so it added to the fun.\n\nThen it was the warm milk and phlegm assembly. I couldn't work out why two smart guys like Tony Sherman and Michael Fees would be doing such a plebe job like milk monitor. Until one day Michael Fees was sick and Tony asked me to help. After much protest—because it meant missing Cocky Laura, the game we used to play after skiing—I gave in. To my surprise, Tony cracked open a bottle of milk and threw another one at me.\n\n\"Is this all right?\" I asked, worried that we might get caught. Tony just laughed, gulped down the entire bottle and said, \"Throw me another one.\" I knew something was unusual but I couldn't work it out until that moment. The milk was actually cold!\n\nFor years we had to drink warm milk that stuck in the back of your throat until lunchtime. Milk that made your mouth so sticky that when you spat the white bulky substance out so that you could breathe, it would fly about a metre but would not forsake your lips. You would then have to step to one side so that you didn't get slimed on the rebound. We used to have competitions to see who could make their spit go the lowest to the ground and still be able to suck it back into your mouth.\n\nThey used to tell us every morning that milk was good for your bones, but this warm vile substance we had to drink bore no resemblance to milk because the place where it was stored directly faced the morning sun. I only drank it because I wanted to compete in the Long Suck. I think that morning I had three gloriously cold bottles. After that, I used to get Tony and Michael to keep a couple of cold ones out of the sun for me. I still went well in the Long Suck as I discovered that a sticky solution could be produced by swilling cold milk in your mouth for a few minutes.\n\nI used to love my Cocky Laura. I don't remember anyone saying \"Oh, let's play skiing\" or \"Let's play Cocky Laura.\" But it was something we would do without fail. We used to have to run from one end to the other and the last two were in. They'd have to go in the centre and we would all run willy-nilly from one side to the other. The people in the centre would have to grab you and say, \"Cocky Laura caught one two three!\" If you got caught you would have to stay in the centre and try and get everyone else out as well. If you were one of the last few, you would have twenty guys waiting for you to make your move then, suddenly, they'd all be on top of you.\n\nAnother beaut game we all used to play was Rumble Rugby. It was played with a soccer ball, a pole at each end for a goal, and basically no rules. You could carry, kick, punt and pass the ball however you liked. Somehow, amazingly, apart from a few grazes and bruises, nobody ever got hurt or got into a fight. It was the most civilised uncivilised game I've ever had the pleasure to play.\n\nOne of the stars of Rumble Rugby—apart from me—was Lee Sterry. Lee Sterry was a natural athlete, a champion soccer and cricket player. He used to be able to score a goal from a corner kick and had fed me many a goal-scoring pass.\n\nOur Padstow North soccer team, captained by Lee, was undefeated. When it came to cricket, he was unsurpassed. He was in the NSW representative cricket side. Another member of our team who was also in representative cricket was Peter Charles. Actually having Lee and Peter in our team was both a blessing and a curse in disguise.\n\nLee would spin bowl and he could make the ball curve greater than inflation. Peter Charles—Charlie for short—used to bowl as fast as hot curry. When one of them was bowling the other was wicket keeping. Really, all we were there for was to fill in the numbers.\n\nI used to play silly mid-on. That, as the name implies, is the most stupid position on the field. You stand about two metres away from the batter in case he blocks one, so you can catch him out. Once, I remember Lee waving me to move closer and I thought, \"If I get any closer I might as well be batting.\" Or if the batter is going to hit the ball for six you can stop it with your head. I never managed to catch anyone out but I did manage to stop a few.\n\nWhen it came to batting, every week Lee and Peter would open and there wasn't a week that went by without the two of them scoring a century. Our cricket team, like our soccer team, was undefeated East Hills district champions. Although nobody else would ever get time to bat. In the whole season, I only ever got to bat once. Seven not out!\n\nUnlike the rest of us who gave up real sport in high school, Lee and Peter kept it up. I used to think that Lee and Peter were the best cricket players in the world, so I can't possibly imagine what stopped them playing for Australia. I've got no idea what happened to Lee, but I know Peter became an apprentice sheet-metal worker, grew his hair long, bought a red Mini Minor, gave up cricket and took up surfing.",

  title: "Chapter 10 - Baradoo",
  raw: `We used to skate down a street called  Baradoo Buradoo was as steep as a cliff and at the bottom was a T join.  Buaradoo claimed many arms and knees, sometimes it even claimed the occasional tooth. Once it even claimed a guy’s toe.
One afternoon, Wayne May, Bunny Parkinson, Michael Hastie and myself were edging our way up Baradoo when suddenly this figure stood at the very top, like a heavyweight fighter after a killer victory, skateboard raised over his head. He let out this ungodly scream that seemed to go on forever. Then he stood on his board and actually started pushing himself towards the bottom.

We couldn’t believe it. You only had to push yourself from the middle of Baradoo and you would end up with the death wobbles, and this maniac was pushing from the very top.

The death wobbles are exactly what they sound like. At a certain speed going down a hill, your skateboard vibrates and shakes until you can’t maintain your balance and you're shaken off. If you were smart you’d look for a soft place to land. The natural reaction is to jump off your board and start running—big mistake. You are moving much faster than you can run . It’s like jumping off a train before it stops. The result is the same: a pile of blood, guts and human being, I know I’ve tried it.

I must admit, this crazy guy had style. It was a good effort. He made it three quarters of the way down before the death wobbles hit, and then he blew it—did the old jump-off and run thing. But he didn’t head for the grass. He splattered on the road and rolled over and over and over until his momentum was finally stopped by a telegraph pole at the very bottom of Baradoo.

We thought it was the funniest thing we had ever seen. Wayne May yelled, “Fuck!”

Then the stranger unravelled himself from the pole and limped towards his skateboard. After he picked it up, he started limping back up the hill at a pace that defied his injuries. We were frozen—the moment belonged to him. As he approached, we could see blood gushing from his bare feet. His feet were mangled and it looked like one of his toes was hanging on by a thread.

As he marched past he nodded, and we all nodded back. Not one word was exchanged. All of us stayed silent until he was out of sight.

“What an idiot!” laughed Wayne May. “Did you see his toe? Legend!”

We never saw him again.

Just over from Baradoo, there was a brand-new, nicely sloping, freshly-tarred road that was perfect for skateboarding. The only problem was it was on private property, and the rumour was the caretaker hated kids—especially skateboarding ones. And if you were sprung riding in there, he’d shoot you. We all accepted the rumour as fact, so no one went in.

But Baradoo was dangerous, and after the toe incident, the temptation became too great.

Wayne, Bunny and I squeezed through the barbed-wire fence. Michael Hastie stayed back, warning us of the dangers. We just poo-pooed him.

It was like heaven—a long, sloping bitumen road smooth enough to change a baby’s nappy on. It was even better than it looked. We were having so much fun that Hastie couldn’t stand it. It wasn’t long before he was screaming down our newly discovered patch of paradise, yahooing like he’d just won the lottery.

All of a sudden, a thundering clap of something massive whizzed slightly above our heads. It scared the shit out of all of us. We fled like tomorrow was cancelled.

I managed to look back and saw a frantic figure waving a shotgun and screaming profanities.

We bolted through the barbed wire, around and into Baradoo—me leading the retreat. Wayne, Bunny and I made it safely, but Hastie was nowhere to be seen.

We peeped around the corner and saw the old man—shotgun and all—trying to wrestle Hastie’s pushbike through the fence. Hastie was hanging onto the other end. The three of us just laughed and left him there.

Apparently he persuaded the old bloke not to shoot him and let him go. He was such a good crawler. We all reckoned he farted and made his escape while the poor old bloke lay writhing on the ground gasping for air.`

  title: "Chapter 11 - Billy Bankstowners",
  raw: `
It used to depress me if I got down to my grandmothers and the surf was flat because it would be a whole week before I’d get another chance to go surfing. The people who were lucky enough to live near the beach used to call the people like us, who weren't so lucky, Billy Bankstowners.

Billy Bankstowners had a bad reputation for driving around Cronulla Beach with their un-waxed Shane surfboards bolted to the roofs of their cars. They would rev-head it up and down the beach, then just park and hang around the carpark in their Speedos, constantly flicking their bleached blond hair, playing loud heavy metal music, smoking joints and perving on the local women.

It was very rare that a Billy would actually go in for a surf. When they did, they would drop in on the locals.

Drop-in is the worst thing you can do to a surfer. You see, when a surfer is on the inside of the wave that’s breaking, they own that wave unconditionally. So if you try and take that wave and, god forbid, actually take off on it, it's a form of trespassing punishable by death. It gives them the god-given right to kill you. Of course, they’re obliged to give you a warning first, which would probably be something like — "FUCK OFF TOURIST!" — screamed in a loud, angry, eerie growl. Sort of like the noise a Doberman pinscher would make if you tried to take the Chihuahua out of its mouth at feeding time.

If you didn't heed that advice, you’d find a surfboard cutting straight up through your mouth out the back of your head, and the fin finally chopping your head off. Or, if you were lucky, or they were having a bad day, they’d only chop your surfboard in half. A few superlatives would also be added in case you hadn't actually realised that you had just made the biggest mistake of your life. It also let other surfers know that you had a disease, similar to leprosy, but it saved you the trouble of yelling “Unclean, unclean!” every time someone came close to you.

Then when you got out of the water, a few of the locals might bash you stupid in case you hadn't felt stupid enough.

I was a little different because I didn't have a car and under no circumstances would I wear Speedos at the beach. Although I used to have to wear them at Bankstown Olympic swimming pool every morning for swimming training.

My dad used to blow his bugle at five in the morning to wake my sister and me up. "RIGHTO, GET UP! RIGHTO, GET UP!" he'd bark. "I'VE GOT THE STEAKS ON! GET UP!" It always took me a while to figure out what was going on. I would almost poo my pyjamas thinking we were in the middle of a fire or something.

If we weren't up by the third call, he would throw a bowl of cold water over us.

Finally I would drag myself into the kitchen and on the table would be a small steak and a glass of chocolate Sustagen. I didn't mind the steak but I was addicted to Coco Pops and Milo, so drinking Sustagen to me was like sucking on a lemon after you had just cleaned your teeth.

My sister didn't mind the Sustagen but was a vegetarian, so she used to play fork hockey with her piece of steak until finally my dad would intervene, "Eat your steak, Debra! It's full of protein and you're going to need all the protein you can get if you're going to swim laps all morning — and you're going to swim laps all morning." She never did and my dad would always complain, "Waste of a bloody good steak! I might as well eat it so it doesn't go to waste."

Then he would drive us to the Bankstown Olympic swimming pool at five-thirty in the morning. He had this particular habit of driving twenty kilometres slower than the speed limit. We were forever being overtaken by Volvos with the drivers wearing white uniforms and bowling hats. It used to drive us nuts.

"Come on, Dad! Can't you go any faster?" we would plead.

"Shut up in the back! Speed kills! Better to be late than dead on time!" was his standard reply.

Meanwhile the car stuck behind him would end up in a head-on collision trying to overtake him. Of course, at five-thirty in the morning we didn't care how slowly he went.

I was always proud that we used to train at Bankstown Olympic swimming pool. I thought if Australia ever won the Olympics, the swimming would be held at our Bankstown Olympic swimming pool. So when Australia did win the 2000 Olympics, I couldn't understand why they wasted millions on the Aquatic Centre when we already had the Bankstown Olympic swimming pool.

After an inquiry, I found out that the Bankstown Olympic swimming pool had been shut down for years. It's a shame really, as it had eight lanes, a low springboard, a high springboard and a slippery dip. They could have included the Face-First-Down-the-Slippery-Dip and the Belly-Flop-Into-the-Water, degree of difficulty 3.5, as an exhibition sport.

The worst thing about training was the cold. Bankstown Olympic pool wasn't heated and it was always so cold, especially at six o'clock in the morning. It was so cold when I first dove in, I would get an ice-cream headache and my balls would migrate so fast up to my stomach for insulation that I was too scared to breathe — I thought they were going to pop out when I opened my mouth.

And the second-worst thing was Sunday nights. After a busy weekend, the water would be green from pee. To combat this, the inspectors would use so much chlorine it could melt the Speedos off a toffee apple in five seconds flat.

We didn't own goggles, so by the end of training on Monday morning our eyes would look as red as a sunset at Alice Springs and feel like they had been poked for two hours with a blunt stick. For the rest of the day we also used to smell like the urinals at Central Station after they had just been cleaned.

I wore Speedos for training, but never at the beach. I knew they weren't hip. Besides, I had the coolest pair of bright orange and yellow floral board shorts, which a bee landed on once and stung me right on one of the flowers. It must have felt ripped off. I didn't care because they were cool — and besides, they were not Speedos.

Another saving grace was the fact that I became a token Bulli local because of the time I spent at my grandmother's house. The other thing that separated me from the Billy Bankstowners was the fact that I could actually surf.

The embarrassing thing was I had to do it on a Shane surfboard. I remember the Christmas I received it as a gift. My parents asked me what I wanted and I kept saying, over and over, that I wanted a surfboard. In the end my father was saying things like, "You'll get what you're given." I think they must have already lay-byed my iridescent green dragster and had no money left.

I remember Christmas morning when I came out into the lounge room with anticipation and saw a Shane surfboard. Tears welled up in my eyes. I didn't want to disappoint them, but I couldn't hide mine. My dad never said anything, but 'You ungrateful sod!' was written all over his disappointed face.

  title: "Chapter 12 - Late Night Shopping, The Sharpies and Bankstown Square",
  raw: `I must admit there were a lot of Billy Bankstowners in Bankstown

There was a circuit where all the Rev Heads used to race around, surfboard and all, every Thursday night. That was our late-night shopping night. Without fail the whole of Bankstown and surrounding districts would lob at Bankstown Square and do laps. It was a mixed culture of surfies and sharpies, oldies and youngies. The sharpies used to hate everyone, particularly the surfies, but an unofficial truce was called for late-night shopping. Well, inside Bankstown Square that was. Apparently outside, the gangs of sharpies used to attack forty to one.

When our family went late-night shopping, we all arrived together, but it was totally UN-cool to be seen with your parents, so once inside we all went our own separate ways. Then at nine o’clock, we met at the World Fair Restaurant and left together. I used to think the World Fair Restaurant was so sophisticated because it had a Hammond organ player. Then we would all go back to my Aunty Beryl’s and Uncle Keith’s for a cup of tea and a biscuit to watch Graham and Burt. This ritual became a tradition for many years except sometime after Gray Gray’s crow call it became Don and Burt.

Aunty Beryl and Uncle Keith weren’t my real aunty and uncle, but my sister and I were not allowed to call them Beryl and Keith because we were too young and it didn’t show them enough respect. But because they were such good friends of my parents, “Mr and Mrs Talbot” was too formal. Hence the Uncle and Aunty. I occasionally bump into the Talbots and, even though I’m nearly forty—old enough to call them Beryl and Keith—as absurd as it seems, it’s still Aunty Beryl and Uncle Keith.

I never went outside of Bankstown Square, so I don’t know if the rumours of the sharpie gang attacks were true. Regardless of the mindless violence, I used to love the way the sharpies looked. They were clean versions of skinheads. They used to wear golf shirts and jeans, both rolled up, and boots and braces. Unlike the skinheads, they all had long hair at the back. Short at the front and long at the back. It is now a popular hairdo with young Europeans and bikies. A friend of mine once described it as not being able to make up your mind if you wanted long or short hair. But at the time I thought that look was The Look.

My dad used to say that if you got the sharpies by themselves, they were useless and that they had a gang mentality. They needed to attack in a gang to feel superior. They scared me because even if you did get one by himself it was like he had forty big brothers. We only had two sharpies at Joey Banks: Danny Fernandas and Mark Alterator.

Mark Alterator was the class clown. I don’t think there was a class where he wasn’t sent out of the room. Before we had Mrs Hubba Hubba Abaid for music, we had a serious man; I can’t actually remember his name. Alterator used to call him Mr Spud Head, and it stuck. Alterator used to call it to his face and get sent out every lesson because of it. At least we were diplomatic enough to only call him Mr Spud Head when we were talking about him. Alterator was such a pain, although at times he was very funny. He was responsible for the first “OINK OINK” in Mr Hog’s class. The trouble was he just didn’t know when to quit.

He was one of the sharpies that was quite useless by himself. I’d seen him fight many times. One of his favourite sayings was, “You’re on, mate!” or “OUT THE BACK!” He always put up a good show but usually got his arse kicked.

On the other hand, Danny Fernandas had a reputation for being a good fighter, although nobody had ever seen him fight; we were all scared of him. He wasn’t a show-off like Alterator or a braggart. He never exerted any force or demanded anything from anyone, but he carried himself in such a way he commanded respect.

One day it was on, out the back: Danny Fernandas and David O’Day. It was in Year Ten and, unlike Danny Fernandas, David O’Day had never been in a fight in his life. Although this would be Danny’s first high school fight. Everyone loved David. He was a champion high and long jumper and a good bloke. I had never heard him say a bad word about anyone. To this day I will never know what the fight was about.

Everyone knew it was on and they were all talking about it.
“I wouldn’t like to be in David O’Day’s shoes!”
“I wouldn’t show up; there’s only half a year to go!”
“You going?”
“Poor Dave…”

It went on all afternoon.

There was a gallery of about thirty. Dave was already there waiting for Danny. Finally he arrived. As usual with Alterator close behind. I wasn’t going to do anything about Danny and David but I thought to myself, If Alterator steps in, I’ll go him.

I was a year older than David but his birthday was the day after mine, which meant something. It was the Thirteenth of May, so for anyone that wants to buy me a present and is not very good at maths, mine’s the Twelfth of May, every year.

Danny didn’t say a word, just shaped up. He had a traditional boxer’s guard except he was doing these fancy twisting movements of the wrist. David said, “I don’t want to fight you.” Danny, still without a word, kicked David fair in the mouth, stared at him for a few moments and silently walked off. Leaving Alterator to pick up his bag, David to wipe the blood away and the rest of us to wonder what had just happened.

Another time I had an encounter with the sharpie thing was at the second and last dance we ever had at Joey Banks. I tell you, it really felt strange being at the school when we didn’t have to. I remember seeing Danny Fernandas dancing with Rhonda Mare. It wasn’t the usual rock-and-roll do-anything-you-like thing, where the more abnormal you can dance the better. They were sort of a long way away from each other, then stepping towards each other one step at a time until they were close, maintaining eye contact the whole time. Then continuing backward in the same direction. Their movements were like a mobile Bruce Springsteen in the Dancing in the Dark video where he pulls that girl out of the audience. I reckoned they were just too cool.

That turned out to be the last dance we had because on the night three guys OD’ed on Mandies. Suddenly Joey Banks realised it had a drug problem. After that we were all trying to get drugs. Once, Tony Freestone, Michael Fees, Greg Achlin, Tony Sherman and I put in and bought a bag of mixed herbs. At the time we all thought it was the real thing. We were running around hallucinating, laughing and carrying on like the world had stopped spinning. Deep down we probably all knew that we were just smoking kitchen herbs but it didn’t matter. Still, to this day it was the best stuff I’ve ever smoked.`,

  title: "Chapter 13 - Tony Freestone",
  raw: "The first dance we ever had at Joey Banks was the Six Class breakup or farewell I remember at primary when we were practising for it. They assembled Six A Six B and Six C, then made us form a huge circle. When they told us what we were about to do, my mouth sank into my heart. My first contact with girls and I had to hold their hands and dance with them. I was mortified. They took us through the movements. Greet your partner, bow, cross hands, circle to the left, circle to the right, skip three paces clockwise or something like that then the girls would move on to the next partner. I was next to my best friend, Tony Freestone. While the girls were spinning around to their new partner, he and I would take off, breaking away as far as we dared. Then back to find the next two girls with bedazzled looks on their faces wondering where their partners were, then jumping twenty feet in shock as we suddenly returned not missing a beat. We thought it was the funniest thing but I can’t remember if we pulled the stunt at the farewell. Tony was great fun. We used to play a game called Flick Rugby. To play the game, you take a tangle piece of paper, cover it in layers of sticky tape and presto, there is your ball. Then you simply flick the ball to the other side of the table, trying to land within an inch of the edge. If you manage this, you've scored a try. The other person has to then put their fists on the table, pointing at each other, pointers joined and thumbs in the air to form the goal posts. Then you have to convert your try by flicking the ball over the posts. As simple as this sounds, it kept us amused for hours. Any time a teacher was sick or for some reason there was a break in the class, straight away it would be Flick Rugby. Tony Freestone was a champion at it and, to make it worse, he would commentate on his efforts, 'And Freestone scores a try! He's got the opposition in a state of confusion, they're not in the same league as Freestone. He lines up the kick, look at his poise, you can tell this is a great champion in action. Yes folks, history is in the making. The opposition put up a valiant effort but again they are just not in the same class as Freestone. Yes! Yes! An easy conversion for Freestone. The opposition looks defeated, they tried everything but it was hopeless. What a great opening two minutes so far.' Another game that Tony excelled in was coins against the wall. We simply used to throw two cent pieces against the wall and the person with the coin closest to the wall wins. Sometimes the haul would be up to twenty cents. Eventually the game was played with twenty cent pieces so the bounty was plentiful. Tony invented a method where his coin would roll along the ground and when it hit the wall, instead of bouncing back like our coins, his would stop dead against the wall every time. He was cleaning up so we had to ban the roll. Tony also excelled at table tennis and billiards. At least ten times I stopped in at his place on my way home and we would play table tennis. He would always beat me, 21 to 8 or 21 to 5; I never got into the teens. We only ever played billiards once, he humiliated me one hundred to nil. I haven't seen him since."

  title: "Chapter 14 - Holidays at the Bulli camping ground",
  raw: "My family used to spend every Christmas holidays across from my grandmothers house at the Bulli Camping Ground  It was in between the beach and the cemetery so it was the perfect playground for a young boy. In our first year we were placed in the last row with only the aisle and one tent separating us from the cemetery. As we were erecting our tent, there was a funeral taking place and I could actually hear one of the mourners crying. It was a bit creepy at first but my attention soon turned to the people in the tent that was nearest the cemetery. The mother was yelling 'You've got too much!' As I was struggling with the bags I was carrying from the car, I just turned to them and said, 'it's alright' then dropped everything. Her young daughter was laughing her head off. She was beautiful. I kept stealing glimpses of her with each load. They were sunbaking but I didn't know why because they were all this incredible brown colour. They were the brownest white people in the world. They were rubbing some sort of baby oil into their skin and I knew that this had something to do with their perfect suntans. Later I found out that it was a mixture of baby oil and iodine, so I guess I was right. The young girl, Denise, came over and introduced herself, then she helped me unload. I figured it was either because of my charm or her mother had made her. She was an older woman, about twelve but within minutes we were wrestling and punching each other, so our friendship was off to a great start. Her brother, Peter, was about twenty and had his nose broken sixteen times. Twice by his elder brother, Rod. Rod's nickname was Stumpy. He wasn't short of a limb; it was because he used to make fences for a living and he was this short, solid bloke. Peter and Rod were animals. They didn't have fleas and wee on the carpet; animals were a gang of renegade surfies. Trouble seemed to follow them around and they loved it. This was their reputation anyway, but all the time we camped opposite them, I never saw them get into any trouble. Of course, I was young and didn't know what they got up to after I was in bed. To me they were just a couple of fun guys that you didn't want to cross. Rod gave me my first ride on a surfboard. He was paddling out and saw me, stopped and, to my delight, asked me if I wanted a go. He pushed me in front of the white water and I was hooked."

  title: "Chapter 15 - Irish Joe",
  raw: `A few nights later  Denise invited my sister and me over to her tent for a seance  It was a spooky affair with the nearby mound of earth covering the newly departed, still unsettled. And their mother, Mrs Celton, a nice lady but all those years of sun, iodine and baby oil had taken its toll on her craggy, old, wrinkly face. Plus, the fact that she enjoyed a beer also didn't help her complexion. In my eyes, it made her look a like a witch. So when I saw her in the dimly lit tent I freaked. The only light was a candle in the middle of a round table. In the centre, there was a glass turned upside down. Around the edge of the table, there were letters and in one corner, numbers. When my sister and I arrived, nobody said hello. Mrs Celton, in a commanding voice, ordered us to take a seat. Denise and I smiled at each other. "Place your fingers on the glass," said Mrs Celton still in command. After everyone complied she began rocking back and forth. Then in a screaming pitch, two octaves higher than her normal speaking voice, asked "Is there any spirits present? If there are any spirits present give us a sign!" Then raising her voice, "I command you to give us a sign!" Suddenly, the glass began to circle the table. If I hadn't been shitting myself, I probably would have found it as amusing as Peter and Denise. "What is your name?" she asked in a low monotonous voice, stretching out the syllables. The glass began to move as if it had a will of its own. From what I could tell, there didn't seem to be any extra force coming from any of the people sitting at the table. The glass sped from one letter to another, spelling out the name Irish Joe. Mrs Celton continued to ask questions and Irish Joe obliged us with some of the answers. Sometimes the glass would not move and she would repeat the question in a firmer, more authoritative tone. Really, I thought, showing no signs for Irish Joe's ghostly sensibilities. A bit scared that he might throw a lamp across the room in protest. She even threatened to terminate his presence. He must have been lonely in the afterlife as it wasn't long before he was dragging his skeletons out of the purgatorial closet. It turned out that he had murdered his wife and lover after he caught them in bed together, then chopped up their bodies with an axe and fed the pieces to his dog. All except her finger which still bore their wedding ring. This he carried around in his purse. Until one day, an observant shopkeeper noticed it when he was buying some rum. Then after Irish Joe had left, the shopkeeper notified the coppers. Irish Joe eluded them for months by hiding out in the bush. Before he was finally convicted and sentenced to hang, he raped a young mother and killed her two-year-old daughter. While waiting for his sentence to be carried out, he was stabbed in the eye, castrated and bashed to death. Then he was given a pauper's funeral and buried at, you guessed it, the Bulli cemetery. I didn't know what to make of it. Peter and Denise were giggling and I put on a brave front. Despite the fact that I told myself that it wasn't for real, to this day I get goosebumps when I think about it. My sister and I, who had never been that close, held hands walking back to our tent. After the story got out, Irish Joe and the Bulli cemetery became an instant hit. All the kids from the camping ground started playing in the cemetery at night. We would run through it screaming "I'm Irish Joe and I've come to get you!" The ultimate was to sneak up behind someone and tap them on the shoulder before they knew you were there. This would usually result in a dry cleaning bill. Once, my new bestest camping buddy, Peter Bobbin, and I were on just such an adventure, when we heard loud, daunting, continuous moaning. We could tell it wasn't another kid trying to scare us. It was a different sound, yet strangely familiar. A hunting sound that sent shivers up and down my spine. Peter and I didn't look back; we were five rows away from the beach before we stopped for air. After we calmed down, we decided that we had to go back and find out what this frightening, yet compelling sound was. The Bobbin's caravan was nearby so we armed ourselves with a torch and a tent peg each. Quietly we crept through the graveyard. In the distance we could hear the moaning. We circled around it. It became louder and louder and faster and faster. As I got closer I could make out two figures lying on top of each other on top of a grave. Suddenly, when we realised that it wasn't Irish Joe killing his next victim and it was our other new bestest camping buddy, Kevin, making love with a girl, we bolted. We were laughing our heads off. That wasn't the only time I accidentally bumped into Kevin bonking. The next night, a bunch of us had just been down the Christian tent and were going to make a fire on the beach, and there he was. Just over the bank, under a street light in full view of the camping area, bum in the air, gyrating about like tomorrow was about to finish. You had to admire his nerve and consistency. I must admit he looked funny. He still had his pants on pulled down to his ankles and he was on his toes, as if he was trying not to get any sand down them.`,

  title: "Chapter 16 - The Christian Tent",
  
  raw: `
The Christian tent was a great social event and it was massive the size of a Ringling Bros tent They seemed to erect it in a blink, then flood the camping area with flyers. Every day the message on them was the same — Fellowship tonight 7pm, all welcome. Free coffee. The whole camping area used to congregate around the Christian tent, except my parents because they were atheists and, as my father put it, “Not interested in such bullshit!”

When I was seven, my parents took me to Sunday School. On the way home my dad gave me the choice of going back to Sunday School or playing soccer. In my first season I kicked twenty-seven goals, and strangely enough, our team's nickname was the “Little Red Devils.”

We only gathered around the tent because it was the only thing happening and it was always good for a laugh. Usually a few of the Bulli locals would come over, drink the bible-bashers’ — as they used to call them — free coffee and take the piss out of them. They would pick holes in their arguments and twist their words. It was very entertaining. I used to barrack for the locals. Although, I secretly admired the way the Christians had a God answer for everything. `,

  title: "Chapter 17 - The Kiosk and The Bulli Boys",
  raw: `The Bulli locals used to hang around the Kiosk The Kiosk was about an hours walk from the camping ground An adult could probably walk it in seven minutes. We used to take the short cut and, by the time we walked over the log bridge, tried to catch some mullet, played sword fights with the palm thingies, went crab hunting in the rock pools and did whatever else young kids did on a long walk in a beach playground, it was about an hour. It was well worth it when you got there! As well as being really nice people the owners of the Kiosk used to make the best chips in the world. I also thought the Bulli locals were the coolest guys in the world. They all had nick names, Jinx, Lenny Cool, Rhino, Ghetto, Charlie Brown, A.J. Happy and many more. I used to envy that. My dad used to call me, Champ, Bruiser or Boof Head. Apart from that I've never really had a nick name. Except when they released Nobby's Nuts. After that, for a little while, it was Nibble Noble's nuts. I used to hate it but no guy wanted to say Nibble Noble's nuts after they realised the implications, so it didn't last for long. The Bulli Boys all seemed to have a particular skill. A unique and special skill, like Baffler. He knew Bulli so well he could be in your car, put his head down and on cue tell you the exact moment you were passing under the bridge or when you were passing a bus stop or the shops. It was uncanny. Useless, but uncanny. That is, unless he ever lost his sight, then he could do the same trick and he wouldn't have to put his head down. Ding was an incredible surfer. Actually, they were all pretty good surfers, except Lenny Cool. In ten summers I only ever saw him in the water once. But Lenny Cool, apart from being cooler than the Fonz, was the best pool player I've ever seen. Monte was a pinball wizard. The kiosk had four machines and 'In Those Days' they only cost five cents. They gave you five balls, which you physically had to pump up yourself. Which was great 'cause you put as many as you wanted into action. They were great machines that actually tested your skill and not ripped you off, like 'Nowadays.' They also went up to like sixty five free games. Monte would pop up about six free games on his first ball, and then walk out leaving any of the boys to come in and have a game. He was such a classy player. First he would pump two balls up, then slightly bump one forward and as it was coming down, he would bump the other one. It would then knock the first ball flying. It would usually rebound at least three times then land in the middle slot or the one that was lit, giving him the most points. While this was happening he would only hold one flipper and when the ball came down trap it with that same flipper. 'Let's do that again,' he would say with a wry grin on his face. And sure enough, up the side the ball would go, rebound three times and into the lit slot. When the games got low, Monte would make an appearance and after one ball, pop up copious amounts of games again. Jinx was an expert on the soccer machine. Nobody could ever beat him. I admit none of these skills would impress a bank manager. Can you imagine Jinx walking in a bank for a home loan then telling the manager, 'I'll play you for it'? But to a ten year old like me, the Bulli Kiosk was an enchanted place inhabited by wizards.`,

  title: "Chapter 18 - Spartacus",
  raw: `Below the kiosk next to the rock pools there is a fifty metre saltwater pool In a big surf the waves used to crash over it, engulfing all the kids who played the "let's go to the far end of the pool and let the waves crash over our heads" game. After the surf calmed down at night, a favourite thing for the campers to do was go prawning. We would walk around the edge of the pool with a torch and a net. As soon as you saw two beady little eyes reflecting the beam—whoosh—fresh prawns for supper.

Once I had a bucket full of prawns and I took them back to my grandmother's, ran a bath and poured them into it. The fresh water makes them spew so they have clean insides. I would have used the word 'vomit', but I can't imagine a prawn vomiting. In my opinion, prawns spew.

One particular prawn would not put his head under the water. I kept pushing his head under but it kept bobbing up. Finally, to teach it who was master, I flicked it, but the bloody thing stuck into my finger. I was in fair pain from the crustacean's assault. So in one sudden swoop, I jerked it off my finger. It rebounded off the wall into the water and just when I thought that was that, the bloody mongrel bobbed its head up again. I looked for something to whack it with, finally settling for my grandmother's brush, returned to the bath—but Spartacus, the warrior prawn from hell, had disappeared.

They were the best prawns I ever tasted. Of course I didn't eat Spartacus. I stuck it to some mahogany and mounted it on my bedroom wall. I think it was up there for about a week before nature forced me to bury it in the backyard.`

  title: "Chapter 19 - My First Toungie",
  raw: `There was always something to do at the Bulli Camping Ground but if we weren t surfing we would be hanging out at the Kiosk or at the Bobbins' caravan. Everyone loved hanging out there because Peter and his two brothers, Ric and Mic, were lots of fun. Plus, the Bobbins had the best collection of comics in the world. You name it—Richie Rich, Mickey Mouse, and nearly all the Donald Ducks ever made. Peter was considered the intellectual because he liked to read 'The Phantom' comics.

It was at the Bobbins that I got my first toungie. One day we were all hanging out as usual, and Peter suggested that we play Spin the Bottle. I thought it was a stupid game that we were all too old for. There was a rather young, enthusiastic, beautiful girl called Karen, insisting that I played. So how could I resist? The annex of the Bobbins' caravan was filled with bunks, and Ric's room was partitioned off by a blanket thrown over a clothesline. I was growing despondent as Peter, Mic, and Kevin had all had a toungie off Karen and I didn't want slops. Finally, when the bottle pointed at me, I felt embarrassed and yet strangely excited. Together we went behind the blanket partition into Ric's room. Then we kissed, and to my surprise, her tongue eased into my mouth. I didn't know people did it like that. We must have been in there for quite a while as the others were yelling for us to come back. I didn't want to see her go off with someone else, so I left straight away. I don't care if Karen had three others before me, she gave great toungie.

Many years later, Karen and I shared another experience. On New Year's Eve at the Bulli Camping Ground, it was a tradition at midnight for all the campers to walk up and down the aisles banging garbage lids, whistling, tooting car horns, ya-hooing, and kissing everyone of the opposite sex you bumped into.

One of my other Christmas holiday buddies was called Peter Gutteridge, Gup for short. He was in his early twenties, had straight, long jet-black hair down to his waist, played guitar, sang like a bird, and had a great sense of humour, which he probably inherited from his father, a jolly old Englishman who wore funny, colourful shorts and made silly jokes like "the green grocer's daughter wouldn't lettuce." Their wind-beaten old caravan had been on the same spot on the beachfront for years, so everybody knew them. I couldn't believe the number of beautiful girls that used to pop in and have a cup of tea with him and his father. 

This particular New Year's Eve, I had no idea where Gup or his father were, but somehow I ended up on a bunk in his annex with toungie Karen. At the exact moment of penetration, the clock struck twelve. Horns, whistles, and cheers exploded through the camping ground. I felt like it was all for me and that I should be taking bows. As I was taking the accolades, "Thank you, thank you," we were both laughing until her sister burst in and, in a panicked voice, said, "What are you doing? Mum's outside and she's looking for you!" Karen threw me to the ground like a Shoot wrestler, quickly got dressed, and left me to bask in my glory alone.`

  title: "Chapter 20 - See You Next Year",
  raw: `Every year when the school holidays had finished we said our good byes It felt really strange   All holidays we were all best friends, living in each other's company for six weeks, then quite abruptly someone would say, 'See you next year,' and you wouldn't see them until next year. Then you would pick up exactly where you left off. There was no 'Hi, what have you been doing for the last eleven and a half months?' It was just like, 'you coming for surf?' Not even a 'good to see you.' Until six weeks later it was, 'See you next year!'

It was sad that not all your new bestest camping buddies could stay for the full six weeks. From four weeks onwards the camping ground starts thinning out. Sometimes you didn't even get a chance to say, 'See ya next year.' Your best buddies' tent or caravan would have suddenly disappeared. It used to make me sad, but in the end I just accepted it because that was the way it was.`

  title: "Chapter 21 - My Bargain Conscious Family",
  raw: `Over the years we moved up the rows and in about our third year we were at the beach front  It was the perfect place to camp. I'd wake up and ask what the surf was like and my dad would open the flap and I could see for myself.

At first, our tent was humble, but adequate. My father always somehow acquired some heashion from work and it made a beautiful floor. It also had four bunks and sleeping bags, a picnic table which opened up and had four seats, a white plastic sink on a stand and a two-burner gas stove. We used an eskie for a fridge. So it had, like my father used to say, 'all the comforts of home'. I'm sure we didn't think so because another of his catch phrases was, 'Stop your whinging! It's not the Ritz Hotel'. As soon as we started whinging about no TV or the mozzies or the milk being warm, it was, 'stop your bloody whinging! It's not the Ritz Hotel.'

By the time we were on the beach front our tent had enlarged. An extension to the kitchen with our very own ice fridge. My mother found it at the Tempie Tip. Tempie Tip was the nick name for a trash and treasure held at Tempie. I only mention that because I didn't want you to have an image of my mother belching her way through the seagulls, rummaging through the rubbish, fighting off the bulldozers and holding up some discarded Eskie yelling, 'Here we go! Give it a bit of a clean, plug up the holes and it'll be as good as new!' It was in beautiful condition but I hated when anyone commented on it because she always went into the fridge rave.

I mean everyone does it. As soon as you compliment someone's jumper or something, they go into the rave about where it came from and the story behind it. That's one of the things that irritate me in life, everything's got a story behind it and people are too willing to tell you it no matter how boring or inane it is. Unfortunately, I inherited this trait from my mother. I often catch myself in the middle of telling someone about the shoes I just bought. Where I got them, what happened to the old ones and my aspirations I hold for the present ones.

My mother's fridge rave was unbearable, 'Yeah, it's good isn't it! I got it for a song! Found it at Tempie Tip and I got it for a song'! Her enthusiasm never waning; 'The guy wanted twenty five dollars and I got him down to twenty but I would have paid a hundred for it. It's worth five times the amount I paid for it. That is if you can get em. 'cause you can't get em any more. Didn't even have to do anything to it, 'cept clean it of course and it's perfect for camping 'cause you know they sell block ice here. And one block lasts a whole week.' Once, she started on the fridge rave and I went for long surf, came back and she was only halfway through it. She was proud of that fridge.

My family has always been bargain conscious. Except my dad, everything had to be brand new with him. I used to love coming home in some old pair of shorts that were three sizes too big for me that I brought in an op shop. 'Look dad, only twenty cents!' His face would bust with disgust, 'You paid too much for them!' He said shaking his head, 'You've got money, buy yourself some new clothes!' I'd stir him up a bit, 'You just can't buy new clothes like this, in this style.' Taking the bait, 'They're all dead peoples' clothes! No son of mine's going to walk around in dead peoples' clothes!' I'd ignore him and model the shorts, hands in pockets doing the can can and with a big smile on my face say stuff like, 'They're fab aren't they?' 'Well at least wash em!' Pushing him to his limits, 'They don't need washing,' 'Christ son, you never know what sort of disease the person had that owned them, they could have had scabies!' I'd just laugh and he would just shake his head.

My grandmother was the worst person to go Op-shopping with. She would grab a safari suit, 'Look Brucie, nothing wrong with this!' Then insist I try it on for size. If I told her it wasn't my size she would tell me to try it on for colour. I couldn't win. Then, while I had it on she would tell me how wonderful it looked and elicit the support of the shopkeepers, or anyone else in the shop. 'He looks good in that, doesn't he?' 'It really suits him, doesn't it?' Sometimes I would have up to five old dears, at a time, telling me how wonderful I looked in a Lime green safari suit. I would get out of it by telling them I had plenty of suits that size and colour at home. Which was usually the truth as I used to Op shop with my grandmother quite regularly. I used to wonder if the old dears worked on commission because it wasn't easy to get out of buying some hideous article of clothing that only Jason Archer could do justice to. If you found a missing button and tried to use that as an excuse, they would spend ten minutes to find one that nearly matched and even offer to sew it on for you. Sometimes, you could get away with pointing out a stain but it was dangerous because they would all have a conference over the stain and usually come up with a remedy. 'If you soak it in some Bicarbonate of soda, eucalyptus oil, lemon juice, sunlit soap and vinegar, it will be good as new.' Please don't try that remedy at home. As I don't remember the exact ingredients of the remedies for stains, I was just using it as an example. So I would hate to see someone go home, try my remedy and ruin their favourite safari suit. However, do know for a fact that most of my grandmother's remedies, from cleaning your teeth to washing the dog for fleas, all contained bicarbonate of soda. So feel free to experiment with that. At first I would just buy anything my grandmother said I looked good in and just take them to another clothes bin after I dropped her off. But then I just started saying it wasn't my style and she would be happy with that.`

  title: "Chapter 22 - Dorrigo",
  raw: `There was only one Christmas holidays when we didn t go to Bulli Instead we went to visit some relatives in Dorrigo  On the way up, I remember my parents telling us that our cousin Jeffrey had a few emotional problems. Apparently, he was prone to temper tantrums and used to bang his head on the floor, sometimes for hours or bite or scratch and kick, if he didn't get his own way. He had to hospitalise many times in the past because of self inflicted injuries. Under no circumstances were we to upset him. Jeffrey was also a very clever and devious kid. It didn't take him long to figure out that he could get away with murder while we were there. There was nothing to like about him. He cheated in every game we played, he never let you have a turn on any of his toys and if you did something he didn't like he would run straight to his mother and in a whingey irritating voice, DOB you in. He owned a thousand toys as well as a banjo, piano, trumpet, guitar and violin, but he had never learned to play any of them. He even occupied the largest bedroom in the house. He was such a horrid brat, I was beginning to believe that I should upset him and let him bash his head against the floor as it might do him so good. The final straw came when we were playing darts and, to my surprise, he said I could have a turn. As I went to take the darts out of the board, the little bastard threw a dart at me and it landed painfully right in the middle of my back. Never in all my years as a kid did I ever run back to my mother and DOB another kid in. But finally I had a chance to catch this mongrel out at his own game. I ran towards the kitchen screaming but just before I reached the door, he pulled the dart out of my back, destroying the evidence. I could only cry in frustration.

The only two other things I can remember from that holiday was milking a cow, which to me felt totally yuck. The other thing was Jeffrey's Shetland pony. He must have done something to it because it was the meanest horse in the world. I should have realised it was a trap when he offered me a go. I'd never been on a horse before, but my dad used to be a jockey, before puberty, so I thought I'd give it a go. I was on the long haired black terror for only a moment, imagining that I was winning a Melbourne cup, before it start to buck like a bronco bull. I landed on my ass and Jeffrey thought it was the funniest thing in the world. Later on I found out that he wasn't allowed to ride the stunted stallion so he couldn't share his delight with anyone else. Just as well, I felt embarrassed enough. Remarkably I didn't punch him in the head or set off one of his attacks. Looking back, I wish I had. I really missed my Bulli pals that year.`

    title: "Chapter 23- The Bankstown Police Boys Military Band",
    raw: "Every Sunday before we visited my grandmother  I had to go to band practice    I was in the Bankstown Junior Police Boys' Band, We were the N.S.W. Junior military marching champions and months before the competition, every Sunday, we had to turn up at the Walton's car park in Bankstown Square and for two hours practise our marching band skills. I used to hate it. It's very hard being in a marching band You have to stay in line with the person in front and beside you, march in time, read the music, watch the drum major and listen out for the bass drum signals. It's very embarrassing if you don't hear the boom boom, boom boom. Which means halt and keep marching straight into the person in front of you probably splitting your lip. All this and trying to play while your instrument is bouncing up and down. It's like trying to sing with the hiccups.I got into it because when I was younger, my family and I went on the Chandress, a poor man's version of the Fairstar. All I can remember from the boat was the confusion with trying to find our cabin, my father getting up on stage and riding a dinky and Toto. Toto was the ship's trumpet player. I thought he was quite amazing. My father took me to meet him and, when I told him that I wanted to play the trumpet, he protested almost with disgust, 'Not the trumpet! You must learn the piano, it's better,' explaining himself, 'Your lips get sore on a trumpet, look at my lips.' There was a semi circle lump on his top lip. I didn't care. To me Toto's trumpet was the sweetest sound in the whole world and that's what I wanted to play. Every day I would go and visit him in the auditorium and he would give me a go, but not before he would try and convince to take up the piano instead. A few weeks after we got back to Australia, my dad took me down to the Bankstown Police Boys' Club to see the junior band master, Barry Grove-Jones. Dad bought me a second hand trumpet that cost about fifty dollars. I guess he didn't want to spend a fortune on an instrument that he thought would just wind up in the back of the wardrobe. It wasn't a cornet like the other guys had, but I loved it. Barry Grove-Jones was a peculiar man. His son Stephen, and his daughter, Jenny, were in the junior band too. They were both excellent musicians but Stephen used to skylark a lot making his father scream at him. Barry Grove-Jones was always screaming, usually at the drummers, 'Common Perdy, you bloody block head, keep time!' and he would never let up, 'You know what a drummer is don't you, a drummer is a musician with his brains bashed out! Now keep the bloody time!' I used to feel sorry for them, but at the same time I was glad it wasn't the cornets he was yelling at. He was hard and expected you to give everything. I remember Barry Grove-Jones telling my father when he took me to suss out the band, that the first six months of learning an instrument is like going up a big hill. 'That's when most quit,' he said, 'but after that it gets easier'. There was no way I was going to quit. The same year I repeated Six Class was the year the band gave me a cornet. The Bankstown Police Boys' owned it, but was mine to take home and look after along as i was in the band. I couldn't believe it, my own cornet. The cornet is a B flat instrument the same as a trumpet. It even has the same fingering but it is shorter in length and has a smoother, sexier sound than the trumpet. Even though it was old and had a ding in the bell, I loved it, started taking it to school so I could practise. I didn't even play Cocky Laura any more, I just wanted to play my cornet. I became quite proficient and the area music director invited me to go on a music camp. At the camp I was given all first cornet parts. Not long after that I was given a scholarship to the conservatory of music. My parents were undecided whether or not to send me. So Dad took me up to Barry Grove-Jones and asked him his opinion. He said that whatever they could teach me I could learn here. And that was that. My father said it was too much to travel into the city every day. I also suspected that they thought that I wasn't mature enough and that the school work would be too hard. The hard thing for me was, not long after that. I was hit in the mouth with a surfboard. This made it hard to play the trumpet for long periods. Barry Grove-Jones suggested that I play the trombone instead. The trombone to me sounds like a bad case of the wind. Also, you have to read bass cleft to play the trombone. I wasn't interested, so I left.One of the highlights of my Bankstown Police Boys' Band career was the Easter Show. All the Police Boys' Bands used to come together and play in the arena at the Easter Show. There were hundreds of cornets and Barry Grove-Jones was responsible for the handing out of the music. I remember he gave me a dirty look, then handed me all first cornet parts. Graduating up to First Cornet was a privilege and with it came responsibilities. Every so often we had to play at an opening or at some function. It was a way for the band to raise money. I used to hate after the gig was over, waiting back at the Bankstown Police Boys' Club for my father to pick me up because felt like such a dork dressed in my bright red band uniform. Once we were sending off a luxury cruise ship at Circular Quay and remember one of the songs had a ridiculously long rest. It was about sixty four bars. The First Cornets usually took turns at counting the rests and today it was my turn. When we got to the break I started silently counting 1,2,3,4,2,2,3,4,3,2,3,4, etc. While I was counting started looking around and saw this woman waving frantically down to the dock. She was so desperate, I tried to see what she was waving at. It was a blind man wandering towards the edge of the dock. Suddenly, some man grabbed him and led him back to safety. Now the excitement had finished, I realised that I had lost count.thought if I don't get ready and we miss our bit I'll be in big strife so I raised my cornet to my mouth, just to blow out all the saliva. All the other cornets followed suit. My eyes were glued on Barry Grove- Jones as he usually looked at the section coming in and indicate the exact moment. I knew we had to be getting close so I brought my cornet to the ready position and once again all the other cornets followed suit. It seemed like an eternity before we got the big nod. No thanks to me we all came in on time. Later on, when the others were telling me off, I explained what had happened and of course they didn't believe me.The best part about band practise was running amok at the club. We finished after everyone had left so the boys in the band would play tip rugby or twenty on the trampoline at a time. Once, I got a little too game on the trampoline and attempted a somersault; in the middle opened my eyes to discover I had gone off the edge and was crashing to the ground. I managed to grab the rail but my feet landed on the floor with a thump. As well as the embarrassment, I had to carry around a limp for a few days.",

    title: "Chapter24- - Leaving School",
    raw: " It never really dawned on me that I would have to leave school and go and get a job   Until in Year Ten we were all sent to a vocational guidance centre. We were asked what sort of work we were interested in doing, and then given a test. My result read, Bruce can do anything he wants, but if he wants to be an electrician he must work on his maths. That was an understatement. Thanks to Mr Sty, my maths needed more that a little work. In the math modulation exam I couldn't answer one question.I had to tell them that my father wanted me to be an electrician, didn't think I could get away with coming home with a result that read - If he applies himself, Bruce has got the aptitude to become a Yo-Yo champion. The only other thing I wanted to do was become a bricklayer but my dad hated that idea too. 'You'll have to work hard all your life!' My dad was protesting, 'it's a dirty, hard job, if you be an electrician all you have to do is walk around with a pair of pliers and a screwdriver in your pocket and you'll never have to get dirty.' Hard work and getting dirty didn't bother me, but there was no way he was going to let me be a bricklayer. So I gave in and agreed. We sent out about fifty resumes and finally I landed a job with Email as an Apprentice Electric Fitter Mechanic. So, I was going to be an electrician. I didn't really know what anyone else was going to do. Except Michael Payne was going to be a fridge mechanic, Peter Charles a sheet metal worker, Malcolm Young was going to go on to Year Eleven and Stephen Seed couldn't wait to go on the dole. The others were undecided or still waiting to hear back from their applications.Muck up day was short, sweet and uneventful, really. Someone had put grease on the hand rails and a couple of windows were broken but that was it. We all ran around writing dumb things on everybody's shirts. Then people were disappearing at their own pace. I said a cheeky good-bye to Mrs Abaid and left. I remember walking home by myself feeling incredibly lonely. Knowing fully that I had just left one world and now I would have to contend with another one. All this happened twenty years ago and I still wonder, where, who?, And what?, about most of my school friends. In all these years the only person from school I've ever bumped into was Tony Sherman. Tony became a bus driver and was living at home in Padstow, in the same house where he grew up. Where once, I had kept him up all night singing 'Born Free'. He was there because he had just had a divorce, and as he put it, 'The Bitch got the house.' The whole time I was looking into his eyes, trying to recognise the boy I grew up with. Tony 'The Tank' Sherman. It was him all right, of course he had put on a fair few pounds and looked like an old version of himself, like we all do. As I was looking at him, some of our memories came flooding back, but I kept them hidden because I didn't want them soiled by the bitter, lonely, unhappy man that was standing in front of me. As for me, I never actually became an electrician, I ended up changing my name to Jimmy Rice, becoming a comedian and writing this book. ",
